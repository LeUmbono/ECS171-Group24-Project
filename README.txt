# My Website README

## Introduction
This README provides the necessary steps to get the website up and running on your local machine.

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:
- All the necessary files downloaded or properly cloned from the repository.
- Python installed on your system
- Any other libraries you may be missing

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download/Clone the Files
Ensure that you have downloaded or cloned all the necessary files for the website.

### Step 2: Avoid Using Code Editors' Play Button
Do not use the 'Play' or 'Run' button in Visual Studio or any other code editor to run the code.

### Step 3: Open the Terminal
Launch your terminal or command prompt.

### Step 4: Navigate to the Website Folder
Change the directory to the folder where the website files are located (under the Website folder).

### Step 5: Run the Application
In the terminal, execute the following command: python app.py


### Step 6: Access the Website
Upon running the command, the website should automatically open in your default web browser. If it does not, you can manually open the browser and enter the local address provided in the terminal (usually something like `http://localhost:127.0.0.1`).

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, ensure all steps above are correctly followed. Check for any error messages in the terminal and address them accordingly.
